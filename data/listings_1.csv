I had an uncle in Rome who passed in 2016 at 107. 

Mexico is my second home. Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta are my main destinations for Mexico . I spend one month there in Nov and 1 month in March. Most of my time is spent mainly in Mazatlan, where I own a condo,  to play tennis and then about  5 days in Puerto Vallarta to Salsa dance. It is the dolce Vita ( sweet life) ,sunny and day time temps of about +28.

I  enjoy hosting on Airbnb mainly because I like meeting new people and having people come from around the world. I use Airbnb whenever I can for traveling around the world because it is so affordable.   Dom and his wife Jessica live close by my home and are co hosts with my airbnb.

Terre-à-terre, proches de nos familles, on apprécie tout particulièrement prendre un verre en compagnie de bons amis.


Quelques destinations ou voyages mémorables: le parc national Kruger et une bonne partie du reste de l'Afrique du Sud en self-drive; un voyage en cargo du Pirée (Grèce) jusqu'à Tanjung Pelepas (Malaisie) en passant par le canal de Suez, Jeddah (Arabie saoudite) et Colombo (Sri Lanka); Naples - une de nos villes préférées;  et la Jordanie en self-drive avec, comme cerise sur le sundae, une visite de la ville ancienne de Petra.  


We're a same-sex couple originally from Winnipeg, Canada. We've been together for over nearly 25 years and have lived in Switzerland, Spain and Canada. While we enjoy cooking when we are at home, we love going out to restaurants when we are on the road, trying new dishes and seeing how other people live and see the world. Down-to-earth and close to our families, we appreciate simple evenings sharing a good glass of wine with friends both new and old.

A few memorable trips: a self-drive safari in Kruger National Park (South Africa), sleeping under a star-filled sky in the Wadi Rum, Jordon, and a trip on the Hatsu Courage (a container ship) from Piraeus (Greece) to Tanjung Pelepas (Malaysia).  And, of course, Naples - one of our all-time favourite destinations.   While in Switzerland, we had the opportunity to travel to many European, North African and Middle Eastern destinations.

As a little girl, I always admired the way a space and its’ contents have the ability to create memories and feelings. One of my earliest realizations of that experience was when my family and I spend a Christmas at a refugee camp when I was 10 years old. We had just escaped communism, leaving everything behind, yet my parents managed to create for us a lovely corner in our room with a small decorated Christmas tree, a bowl of nuts, some Mandarins, and even a few small presents. I still remember wondering how they managed to put this together for my sister and me? It was the loveliest feeling and that wonderful memory is still vivid in my mind as one of my very favorite Christmases. 

Perhaps it is this experience in leaving our life and all our worldly possessions behind to start again, which makes me always pause in a space and take in how it makes me feel. I truly believe in the wonder and emotional connection to the things that we choose to surround ourselves with. 

I have also been fortunate to put my head down on a pillow in many lovely places during my 20 years of executive global travel. I have come to appreciate that there are a few essentials that have always put a smile on my face and made me feel at home while traveling away from home. It is with this mindset that my family and I have approached the creation of this loft, our special space. 

A beautifully-appointed loft, with comfy bedding and linens, lovely amenities, all the comforts of home, and an opportunity to connect with locals, are but a few of the things that we hope our home and family can offer. We are passionate about our city and would love to share everything that may be of interest to you about Winnipeg. There is so much to discover and talk about in English, French, or Czech if you prefer.
We look forward to meeting you.

I've lived in Winnipeg for over 20 years and can help with any questions about the city - as well as the many events. 

My house in an amazing area and it's unlike many other airbnb's. It has a dog playground. The back yard is equipped with a cute dog house, hay bales and is fully enclosed with a new six foot fence. Inside I always have a kennel, bowls and an oversized dog mat setup. That said it's always clean and tidy. 

I work at a travel lodge a few hours away with my dogs. So, the place is for rent while I'm gone. It's a place I love and a sanctuary for all. 

Previously I was a Commercial Property Manager and a Real Estate Photographer. With this experience and attention to detail, providing quality accommodation comes second nature.

As a world traveler, I know the comforts that make a stay relaxing. Things like a full kitchen, morning coffee/tea, books to read, snacks upon arrival and even just knowledgable neighbours really make a difference.

In the reviews you will see many for other properties I've managed. The property is new but the host (myself) is the same. So you'll see I'm quite experienced and love to help people have fantastic vacations. 


I hope you enjoy your stay and if there is anything I can do to make it better just let us know.

We are so excited to host you during your stay! Being avid travelers ourselves, we love the experience AirBNB has provided being able to experience life as one of the locals in wherever we're going. We wanted to give the same experience to people visiting our properties and be able to provide the most incredible accommodations to all of our guests.

We obsess over every detail and have an incredible team to ensure our properties are cleaned and maintained to the highest standard prior to your visit. Our guests' book with us for a reason, and we'd love to host you for you to find out why.

Currently we are helping homeowners from across the country manage their investment properties / vacation rentals by welcoming guests into their homes through our property management business, Blue Bell Properties. We are a hands-on short term rental management company and handle all the logistical work that goes into managing short term rentals. Showcasing these properties to look their best and bring in higher returns for our partners and investors is just a small part of what we do.

If you like the idea of short term rentals, but simply don't want to handle the day to day management of dealing with guests, coordinating maid staff and maintenance, managing your calendar, and marketing your property to earn the highest nightly rates possible, feel free to contact us and we'd be happy to have a complimentary consultation with you and see if we are a good fit for your needs. We look forward to serving you and making your short term rental experience as hands off as possible and something you’ll love for years to come!

We hope you enjoy your stay with us and can experience everything our amazing properties have to offer!",within an hour,100%,99%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/3ff427d6-7f37-4f98-883c-93816c8096da.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/3ff427d6-7f37-4f98-883c-93816c8096da.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Lord Roberts,5,5,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada",Fort Rouge - East Fort Garry,,49.86231246871449,-97.13348876684904,Entire home,Entire home/apt,6,,2.5 baths,,3,[],$128.00,1,100,1,2,1125,1125,1.3,1125.0,,t,0,0,0,0,2023-12-17,27,27,3,2023-04-18,2023-12-05,4.75,4.75,4.79,4.68,4.89,4.75,4.68,,f,5,5,0,0,3.32

With my passion for all things beautiful, delicious, and culturally diverse, I've made a name for myself in the world of food and hospitality, having opened my own restaurant and built a reputation for creating stunning dishes and memorable dining experiences.

As a former Senior Logistics Officer, I have a unique perspective on the importance of comfort and convenience, and I've incorporated these principles into our Airbnb listing. My home is designed to provide guests with a relaxing and worry-free stay, whether they're here for business or pleasure. From the cozy bedding to the fully equipped kitchen, I've thought of every detail to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.

When I'm not in the kitchen or at my restaurant, you can find me exploring new destinations, discovering new music, and soaking up local cultures. My love for travel and adventure has taken me to some of the most amazing places in the world, and I can't wait to share my stories and recommendations with you.

So, whether you're a foodie looking to experience the best of local cuisine, a music lover looking for new tunes, or simply in need of a comfortable and convenient place to stay, I'm here to make your stay unforgettable. I look forward to hosting you soon!

We are so excited to host you during your stay! Being avid travelers ourselves, we love the experience AirBNB has provided being able to experience life as one of the locals in wherever we're going. We wanted to give the same experience to people visiting our properties and be able to provide the most incredible accommodations to all of our guests.

We obsess over every detail and have an incredible team to ensure our properties are cleaned and maintained to the highest standard prior to your visit. Our guests' book with us for a reason, and we'd love to host you for you to find out why.

Currently we are helping homeowners from across the country manage their investment properties / vacation rentals by welcoming guests into their homes through our property management business, Blue Bell Properties. We are a hands-on short term rental management company and handle all the logistical work that goes into managing short term rentals. Showcasing these properties to look their best and bring in higher returns for our partners and investors is just a small part of what we do.

If you like the idea of short term rentals, but simply don't want to handle the day to day management of dealing with guests, coordinating maid staff and maintenance, managing your calendar, and marketing your property to earn the highest nightly rates possible, feel free to contact us and we'd be happy to have a complimentary consultation with you and see if we are a good fit for your needs. We look forward to serving you and making your short term rental experience as hands off as possible and something you’ll love for years to come!

We are so excited to host you during your stay! Being avid travelers ourselves, we love the experience AirBNB has provided being able to experience life as one of the locals in wherever we're going. We wanted to give the same experience to people visiting our properties and be able to provide the most incredible accommodations to all of our guests.

We obsess over every detail and have an incredible team to ensure our properties are cleaned and maintained to the highest standard prior to your visit. Our guests' book with us for a reason, and we'd love to host you for you to find out why.

Currently we are helping homeowners from across the country manage their investment properties / vacation rentals by welcoming guests into their homes through our property management business, Blue Bell Properties. We are a hands-on short term rental management company and handle all the logistical work that goes into managing short term rentals. Showcasing these properties to look their best and bring in higher returns for our partners and investors is just a small part of what we do.

If you like the idea of short term rentals, but simply don't want to handle the day to day management of dealing with guests, coordinating maid staff and maintenance, managing your calendar, and marketing your property to earn the highest nightly rates possible, feel free to contact us and we'd be happy to have a complimentary consultation with you and see if we are a good fit for your needs. We look forward to serving you and making your short term rental experience as hands off as possible and something you’ll love for years to come!

We hope you enjoy your stay with us and can experience everything our amazing properties have to offer!",within an hour,100%,99%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/3ff427d6-7f37-4f98-883c-93816c8096da.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/3ff427d6-7f37-4f98-883c-93816c8096da.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Lord Roberts,5,5,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada",River Heights - Fort Garry,,49.86703379999999,-97.1638567,Entire home,Entire home/apt,5,,1 bath,,2,[],$104.00,1,60,1,2,1125,1125,1.3,1125.0,,t,27,57,87,176,2023-12-17,5,5,2,2023-07-31,2023-11-25,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,f,5,5,0,0,1.07

We are so excited to host you during your stay! Being avid travelers ourselves, we love the experience AirBNB has provided being able to experience life as one of the locals in wherever we're going. We wanted to give the same experience to people visiting our properties and be able to provide the most incredible accommodations to all of our guests.

We obsess over every detail and have an incredible team to ensure our properties are cleaned and maintained to the highest standard prior to your visit. Our guests' book with us for a reason, and we'd love to host you for you to find out why.

Currently we are helping homeowners from across the country manage their investment properties / vacation rentals by welcoming guests into their homes through our property management business, Blue Bell Properties. We are a hands-on short term rental management company and handle all the logistical work that goes into managing short term rentals. Showcasing these properties to look their best and bring in higher returns for our partners and investors is just a small part of what we do.

If you like the idea of short term rentals, but simply don't want to handle the day to day management of dealing with guests, coordinating maid staff and maintenance, managing your calendar, and marketing your property to earn the highest nightly rates possible, feel free to contact us and we'd be happy to have a complimentary consultation with you and see if we are a good fit for your needs. We look forward to serving you and making your short term rental experience as hands off as possible and something you’ll love for years to come!

We hope you enjoy your stay with us and can experience everything our amazing properties have to offer!",within an hour,100%,99%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/3ff427d6-7f37-4f98-883c-93816c8096da.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/3ff427d6-7f37-4f98-883c-93816c8096da.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Lord Roberts,5,5,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Fort Rouge - East Fort Garry,,49.86150071349486,-97.13473087445347,Entire home,Entire home/apt,4,,1 bath,,2,[],$79.00,1,365,1,2,1125,1125,1.3,1125.0,,t,23,53,83,262,2023-12-17,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,f,5,5,0,0,

We are so excited to host you during your stay! Being avid travelers ourselves, we love the experience AirBNB has provided being able to experience life as one of the locals in wherever we're going. We wanted to give the same experience to people visiting our properties and be able to provide the most incredible accommodations to all of our guests.

We obsess over every detail and have an incredible team to ensure our properties are cleaned and maintained to the highest standard prior to your visit. Our guests' book with us for a reason, and we'd love to host you for you to find out why.

Currently we are helping homeowners from across the country manage their investment properties / vacation rentals by welcoming guests into their homes through our property management business, Blue Bell Properties. We are a hands-on short term rental management company and handle all the logistical work that goes into managing short term rentals. Showcasing these properties to look their best and bring in higher returns for our partners and investors is just a small part of what we do.

If you like the idea of short term rentals, but simply don't want to handle the day to day management of dealing with guests, coordinating maid staff and maintenance, managing your calendar, and marketing your property to earn the highest nightly rates possible, feel free to contact us and we'd be happy to have a complimentary consultation with you and see if we are a good fit for your needs. We look forward to serving you and making your short term rental experience as hands off as possible and something you’ll love for years to come!

We hope you enjoy your stay with us and can experience everything our amazing properties have to offer!",within an hour,100%,99%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/3ff427d6-7f37-4f98-883c-93816c8096da.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/3ff427d6-7f37-4f98-883c-93816c8096da.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Lord Roberts,5,5,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,St. Vital,,49.85640304193438,-97.10983740631542,Entire home,Entire home/apt,6,,2.5 baths,,3,[],$117.00,1,365,1,2,365,365,1.3,365.0,,t,25,55,85,264,2023-12-17,1,1,1,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,f,5,5,0,0,1
